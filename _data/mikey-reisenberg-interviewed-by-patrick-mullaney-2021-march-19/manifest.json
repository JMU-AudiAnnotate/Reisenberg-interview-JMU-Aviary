But, you know, at the same time, I understand in some ways that they wanted to really push the American immersion aspect of their ESL courses. They wanted to give people the experience of speaking with someone who is from a different place, looks different from you, and sounds different from you. And I guess I see their line of thinking. I'm upset still, that I didn't have the opportunity to go back to Korea, visit, and experience the culture firsthand.

And, you know, I'm still treated like an immigrant by some different groups of people that wouldn't know me. But I don't think that it's something that I recognize in myself necessarily. I think it's more that my experience is more colored by feeling as though I am 100% American, but knowing that I look a completely different way and that I was born in a completely different area. And the struggles have been more for finding balance within myself as to who I assume I am as my cultural identity in relation to the identity that is imposed upon me by those who are not as well versed in cultural identities or notions of adoption and being from someplace else but still having an idea that you are an American and that you have assimilated and become part of this society in this culture.","format":"text/plain"},"target":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886#t=467.73,557.49"},{"id":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886/transcript/39113/annotation/23","type":"Annotation","motivation":"transcribing","body":{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Patrick Mullaney: Okay, right.

I respect anyone and everyone who chooses to adopt children for their own family. Whether it's domestic or international, I respect both of those lines of thinking equally. The reason for it is because in my own life and in my own experiences, I always wonder about the what ifs. You know, what if I wasn't adopted by this family that loves me, and cares for me, and has supported me throughout all 35 years of my life, and where could I be if I was still born, but was never adopted and was left to be raised by the state in Korea, and to go without that kind of support structure. And I think that there are a lot of families out there that have their own reasonings and concerns for having their own biological children. And I think adoption is a very viable and very respectable way of creating your own family while also benefiting society. Diversified family groups are the ones that you can see and feel the love the absolute most, because I believe that they are the ones that truly care about the children. And the children do truly care about their families and their parents that are the adoptive parents. Because it's one of those things that - love is not necessarily obligatory, even though it feels that way. I think that love takes work. And I think that it's [pause] something that everyone needs to work on, even in a parent child kind of relationship. And in my experience, I feel as though my family has been flushed with love and support. And those are the - those are just my feelings, anecdotally. But I know that I've run into a bunch of adoptees that also speak very much the same way as I do with their biological family. They have questions about - and interest about -  but at the same time, they know that their family, their mom, their dad, their brothers, or their sisters are always the family that they go home to, that they eat dinner with, that supports them, that hugs and kisses them at the end of the evening. And I think that that's a really important thing that American society should further embrace is the idea that adoptions whether domestic or international are a positive thing for everybody.","format":"text/plain"},"target":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886#t=573.09,723.69"},{"id":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886/transcript/39113/annotation/25","type":"Annotation","motivation":"transcribing","body":{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Patrick Mullaney: Okay, so, we're gonna move on to a different topic.

And we actually went all the way up into Pennsylvania - at 11 years old with my mother, and my father, and myself. And my job was to use a pickaxe to dig a trench in a driveway. And the clients of my father actually came out and asked if I was being paid, and if I was being taken care of appropriately. [chuckle] And I told them that I was out there to work and to earn money.

And the reason for that is because in my later high school years, I became very interested in food preparation. And it became kind of a [pause] cathartic experience for me and therapeutic experience for me to apply myself, learn new skills, and take raw ingredients and create something completely different by the end process. [pause] Yeah, it's basically that experience led me to bussing tables at [unclear] Italian Eatery when it was still in town - serving tables - and other restaurants like the Woodfired Oven, Simple Pleasures, learning catering from that same business as well because they were a banquet and catering facility. During my stents in all of those restaurants I also spent a lot of time with the cooks because they were the people that worked the hardest, joked[?] to the most, drank and partied the hardest. And for some reason that appealed to me. And I love to see the kind of banter that occurred inside of the kitchen, where teamwork occurs, but they're still having a good time, they're sweaty, they're still working hard, but they're still having a fun time while doing it. And that's kind of what gravitate - kind of encouraged me to gravitate towards the back of house. But the formative experience of my restaurant careering is in the Joshua Wilton House, the local fine dining restaurant here in town, under the mentorship of Mark Newsome and Tom French, who were - and Tom French is still the executive chef at that restaurant. And they taught me a ton about how the kitchen operates, and how the standards of the kitchen in a restaurant are established, and how we can always push and serve the highest quality product and provide the [audio cut out] quality service  experience that's possible on pursuit of perfection. And those have humongous influences on me and my professional life.","format":"text/plain"},"target":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886#t=840.0,983.67"},{"id":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886/transcript/39113/annotation/29","type":"Annotation","motivation":"transcribing","body":{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Patrick Mullaney: Okay, nice.

In the evenings when I wasn't in the libraries, I was also serving tables in restaurants and at the Wilton House, and it was basically just a full schedule of work, school, and work again. And so I spent very little time enjoying the JMU campus and immersing myself in the JMU college lifestyle. I was more all business at that point.

I had such a full workload between work and school that I didn't really have a lot of free time to spend with other people.

So I befriended more of the people in the restaurants and the hospitality department than I ever did in like the history department, or on the quad or anywhere else.

And I felt that that information was empty, or not as valuable. And I think that once I switched my major to History, I was able to acquire a broader range of knowledge about the globe, about people, about concepts, thought processes, religions, and almost anything else and under the sun - culture - that has allowed me to feel confident in being able to talk my way into a position anywhere and have some kind of foundational knowledge that allows me to have a springboard for learning quickly and - got to becoming a either a staff member or an employee that is valuable. So yes, in some ways, the educational side of things did prepare me for owning a business. But I think that the pathway in the road to becoming a manager or being successful, in this sense, required hands on experience, which is one of the reasons why I spend all of my waking time in restaurants and other - at other people's businesses, as an employee in order to try and learn firsthand from the people that were actually living that life.","format":"text/plain"},"target":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886#t=1231.23,1349.04"},{"id":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886/transcript/39113/annotation/37","type":"Annotation","motivation":"transcribing","body":{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Patrick Mullaney: Okay, just sort of like the last question in the sort of section.

I am what you would call a self-taught cook. Like I said before, when I was in the restaurant industry, I spent all my time with cooks. The reason for it is because - at the time I needed a Spanish credit for a class and pretty much everyone I was working with was from Mexico, Honduras or El Salvador. So it was [unclear] fun to try and practice Spanish with them. But as we practiced Spanish, they would practice their English. And one of the routines we got into was trying to describe to one another, how to cook food, and why we were cooking food the way that we were. So I got cooking lessons from El Salvadorians and Hondurans and Mexicans cooking Italian food in broken English and Spanglish. And, like I said, coming full circle back to your other questions about languages, I had to learn a little bit about how to communicate with these people so that we could at least understand one another. They taught me how to prep noodles, and make sauces, and how to shorten your time on cutting onions and things like that - how to hold a knife. So I get a lot of my actual culinary training from people that were living that life. I also need to give a bunch of credit to my family who were very much adamant about having the family together at dinner times to enjoy a meal together, to share our experiences about the day, and actually perform activities like a core household. And so my family cooked meals from scratch all the time. [pause] It was kind of disappointing when I would visit other friends houses and they would have Kraft mac-n-cheese and frozen pizzas. Because I was always so used to home cooked meals and [pause] things made from scratch. So it kind of made me turn my nose up a bit. But then learning more and more about the culinary arts from the people living it gave me more knowledge to build upon. It's kind of like building a foundation for a house you get certain blocks that become pivotal and your abilities to expand on skills and knowledge. And as the years progressed, and as I was working in different restaurants with different types of ingredients and different types of people I acquired new skills and built on the stuff that my family taught me which was, you know, salt stuff early - salt stuff late too - so then it's seasoned all the way through, and then it tastes good from start to finish. Never forget pepper. [laugh] You know, there's ways in [unclear] made sure to create a starting point for that knowledge. And I think a lot of it came around to you know, what pans you use for different products. I never cook eggs in anything other than nonstick pans now because my folks are always like \"this is the way to do it\". \"You'll always have faster cleanup\". But we still use some of those elements in the restaurant today even in a commercial sense. Again, much credit to Mark Newsome, who's now on the Outer Banks and Tom French who is still the executive chef at the Joshua Wilton House for their desire to take someone like me who is just very interested in food but very ignorant about food and to allow me to learn from them, for me to bring in food for them to try and to assess, and to give me critical feedback on. They deserve a lot of credit -them and my folks both -  for being able to teach [?] me the lessons and teach me the way of the knife and the way of the kitchen.","format":"text/plain"},"target":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886#t=1496.34,1736.16"},{"id":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886/transcript/39113/annotation/41","type":"Annotation","motivation":"transcribing","body":{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Patrick Mullaney: Okay.

Well, some of the things that I love the absolute most in this world is pork belly and mushrooms. So, I at one point really focused on learning proteins, and seafood, and all of those kinds of things. Because every protein operates differently, behaves differently when cooking and all of that. So, I love to slow roast pork bellies. I love to cure pork bellies for bacon. As of right now we're in the woods looking for places to find mushrooms c- and the local wild foraged mushrooms are one of the thing that excites me more than anything in this world. But really in a lot of ways at home, when I cook for myself - I cook for my wife and I very simply. A lot of times it's steaks and simple blanched vegetables. A lot of times for me personally, I love to make Cacio e Pepe, which is an Italian style dish that is [background noise] basically boiled pasta with a black pepper and parmesan sauce, made with emulsified butter. And it is absolutely delicious. It's kind of like buttered parmesan noodles that a lot of my friends' parents used to make for their kids when they were growing up. [pause] But yeah, I mean, when we ended up cooking in the restaurant is when we ended up putting much more focus on elegance, and presentation, and contrasting flavors. And all of these kinds of things. I'd say that the way that we ended up presenting dishes at the restaurant - that I really enjoy- is incorporating the five major characteristics that constitute taste, which is sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. And the combination of all five of those characteristics into a single dish pretty much ensures that you'll have an explosive flavor profile. The balance that you find between those five senses of flavor also are very important because - to counterbalance something like salt, you can make it either more sweet, or you can add acid to cut that saltiness. But again, you don't want to take a dish that's supposed to be sweet and savory and then push it into the realm of being too sharp by using acid if you over salt and over season. So, one of the things that I love the most is creating any new dishes, and executing those dishes, and teaching my staff how to perform those actions and perform those functions so that when you visit the restaurant, you can't tell whether it's me or my staff that's performing that product for you.","format":"text/plain"},"target":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886#t=1748.52,1924.74"},{"id":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886/transcript/39113/annotation/43","type":"Annotation","motivation":"transcribing","body":{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Patrick Mullaney: Okay.

And for me personally, I always like to say that, as a chef, I endlessly romanticize food. And I stand on the shoulders of those who came before me. So I take the knowledge and the skills that have been passed down through generations of previous cooks. And that becomes my starting point for understanding a dish. For reinventing a dish - to start- you may already have an idea of how, let's say, peanut butter and jelly sandwich should be presented. And what we'll do is have an understanding of what a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is: good quality bread, good quality peanut butter - whether it's creamy or crunchy - and then your choice of a flavored sweetened fruit preserve. Let's say we want to flip that on its head then understanding that it's a simple sandwich with sweet components, creamy and fatty components to cut the sweetness of the jelly, and then the bread also to provide you backbone and substance to the dish. So, what we may end up doing is taking and dissecting the whole thing. Let's say we want to make a peanut butter and jelly dessert instead where we take a Japanese milk bread for example, and lightly fry it so that it has crispy texture to it - kind of like a toasted peanut butter and jelly sandwich. But then let's say that we'll make a peanut butter nougat or a peanut butter mousse instead. And then garnish with fruit jelly[?] cubes and herbs, for example, to bring an entirely different note of flavor and presentation to the dish. But really, it's just taking and reinventing dishes according to - paying respect to - the original concept and the idea. But then also reminding yourself that you have a world of possibilities that are capable for you to be able to expand upon as well. Building new dishes is different. For me personally, taking the romanticism aspect again, I remember food experiences more clearly than anything else in my life. And as an example, when I was a child, we used to get together for a bunch of different kinds of family reunions, and I had seven aunts who always thought they were the best cooks. At any of these family reunion events, all seven of these women would force spoonfuls of food into your mouth. And you'd have to eat and try every single thing. And then tell people what was the tastiest and why. And then the ladies would fight amongst themselves as to who's better at cooking than the others. But it became a really interesting experience, because again, it focused on the fact that - I hated Ambrosia salad growing up. I still hate Ambrosia salad, and I can still remember what it tastes like when that spoonful was shoved into my mouth at about four or five years old. I can tell what it tastes like[?]. So, if we were ever to do an Ambrosia salad for us [chuckling], through the restaurant, we would completely dissect that dish in order to create something new that excites us, and also is something that tastes good. [chuckle] Grits, brussel sprouts, are also other perfect examples of things that growing up I absolutely hated. It didn't seem like my family knew how to cook any of these things. Once I learned how to cook them from different chefs and fine dining establishments - now we employ those techniques all the time. I love eating those things. And now we're using those ingredients to expand on other ideas like brussel sprout risottos or whatever it may be, where we can incorporate those kinds of flavors into new dishes and pair them with different mouth feels, textures, and flavor sensations in order to maybe introduce brussel sprouts to a new individual - or if you already love them to have you notice a way that they can taste different or be applied differently than what you've already had and different from a traditional method.","format":"text/plain"},"target":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886#t=1944.6,2217.96"},{"id":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886/transcript/39113/annotation/45","type":"Annotation","motivation":"transcribing","body":{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Patrick Mullaney: Okay, thank you very informative.

But my American family, as tourists, were treated much, much differently in England and in Europe, because of the notion that we are arrogant, and that we are not polite, and that we were severely individual.

Shoot, well, yeah, the community did anyway, through us at sincera, the outreach, medical centers of all different varieties, Food Lion, the USPS, schools, all sorts of different places, ambulances, firefighters, anyone and everyone that's out there making sure that our lives run, the way that we expect it to, and ensuring that the level of safety and comfort that we enjoy every day, that we showed the appreciation to those people that are working the front lines always. We also decided to pivot further and expand our business hours. And from 11, to seven until 11 to nine, we also expanded our business hours to include another day, which is Monday. So we're now open Monday through Saturday from 11am to 9pm. And I have to give a lot of credit to my staff and the people that work with me, because those are the people that help make these kinds of pivots happen. And keeping all of those folks happy, safe, healthy, has been one of the most challenging parts of the pandemic, especially because public distrust of each other. And concern over safety means that lots of restaurants closed up last year. And a lot of businesses in general went under last year because people were not able to spend their money to support us. And we did everything in our power to try and mitigate those kinds of losses and those kinds of obstacles. But everybody has been in bad shape after last year. So we're hoping that this year with better COVID numbers, vaccinations rolling out all over the place, that hopefully at some point, we can return to some level of normalcy and see booms in business that a lot of us small guys really have to have if we're going to stick around.","format":"text/plain"},"target":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886#t=2476.2,2654.13"},{"id":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886/transcript/39113/annotation/53","type":"Annotation","motivation":"transcribing","body":{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Patrick Mullaney: Yeah.

I'd say that no, I personally have not. But I do know that there are some of my Asian friends that have definitely run into more of that than I have. [pause] The nice part about Harrisonburg is that we are insulated from a lot of the things that happen on a national and on a global level and - fashion trends come here later. They leave later. Food trends come here later, they leave later. Different elements of political issues hit us differently, whether it's later or not to the same degree, or it's focused in like the rural communities. I'm not gonna say that there's no racism here. That's not true. That's, that's just a distorted thing because there's so many progressive minded and open minded, kind, good individuals in this area. But there's also a bunch of people that are very rural and have never had the experience of getting to know someone like me, or anyone else. And it gets to be so that they still have reservations about people that look and sound different than them. Again, I'm blessed to be an American, sound like an American, to feel and act like an American. And it gives us an advantage over some of the people that I know, because I know that for instance, I like to give credit to the Spanish food trucks and the - anyone else that's been doing food service, other than us, that just is not able to explain what they do, and to discuss their passion for the industry the same way that I can because of language barriers. And I think that those people deserve as much credit as anyone else because they're out there living the same lifestyle as us every day. And oftentimes, they're cooking just as good, if not better food, than the people that get all of the press. So [pause] yeah, it's an interesting thing, being an American, but looking different than everyone else - but sounding like everyone else as well. [pause] It provides advantages and disadvantages depending on who you're speaking with. I actually run into more issues with Korean Americans that speak the language and are fully immersed in the Korean culture than with anyone else personally.

Last year was the most difficult in sourcing products because entire industries were shutting down during the height of the pandemic. A lot of our products, even though they are sourced locally, require larger scale distribution efforts. So whether it's the farms that shut down, or the distributors that shut down, or whatever, that caused a lot of problems for us last season. This season, we're still running into issues where there's a national tofu shortage, mostly from what I'm told due to lack of soybean farms that are able to produce the same volumes. And it's an interesting thing, because now we're running into sourcing issues all over again, about different products and ingredients that we never thought we would run into. Some of our products are by-products of larger industries, that - for instance, our ribeye comes from a distributor where they cut random ends off of big primal cuts. And then they sell the randoms at a reduced cost. So we can use that for our beef bulgogi style preparation. And those kinds of avenues are only available if other restaurants are purchasing rib eyes in the same volume where they have that random cut available. So, the natural downturn - and then volume of business that we're all seeing has actually impacted our industry and our ability to source products as much if not more, than industries actually shutting down. Again, we mitigate a lot of those problems because we are trying to source locally and we've got a lot of avenues with local farmers that get us the kinds of goods and ingredients that we need on a day-to-day basis. But every once in a while, we run into things where we have to basically cutting an item out of our prep and off of our menu for a short period of time while we actually relocate those things. I'll be glad when it's all over and you can buy anything you want from the grocery stores or from your distributor or wherever. No more toilet paper shortages and all that.","format":"text/plain"},"target":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886#t=2894.07,3035.97"},{"id":"https://jmu.aviaryplatform.com/collections/2007/collection_resources/76588/file/162886/transcript/39113/annotation/61","type":"Annotation","motivation":"transcribing","body":{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Patrick Mullaney: Yeah, okay.

And sometimes they're right. They are not always right. And we always stick to our guns that if we have set a protocol in place, and we have rules, then we expect our customers and our staff to follow them. And we will refuse service to people and ask them to leave if they put us in a position where we feel uncomfortable, or if they make others feel uncomfortable. And [background noise] it's not really something that we enjoy doing. But it's something that we feel like is our responsibility for the safety of everyone. And also for the fact that our governor has established rules and mandates that regulate our abilities to allow those customers into our spaces. So, for the threats of the state revoking our business' licenses and our abilities to be a business after these kinds of events happen - we're basically doing everything that we can to educate the public that we're doing this for you, and that we're asking you to leave because you are not following the rules that make it so that we can sustain and continue working as a soluble business. [pause] It's tough, though, to be honest. I mean, you I'm sure you all have seen the videos of people that freak out when guests [?] leave stores or to put on masks. Anytime you go [?] even still, even after all the education from the WHO and the CDC and everyone else. People don't wear their masks correctly, they might as well be wearing it over their eyeballs because they're blind to all the information that's out here.
